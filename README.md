The Historical Settler and the Competitor:
In the 42 years since Super Rugby started, the Crusaders and Blues have played each other. The Blues have won 12 and the Crusaders 32, with one match drawn. Despite battling the Pro12's confidence throughout the season, the Crusaders have set a phenomenal record, with 17 victories in their last 18 outings.
This long-standing rivalry has featured fierce matchups, memorable postseason runs, and a touch of "bad blood" often accompanied by a healthy dose of mutual respect. The Crusaders beat the Blues in the Plunket Shield yesterday, but not as much as in the final of the Super Rugby at Eden Park at 2022, so secured their eleventh title. Suddenly, the Blues managed to finish their long winning streak.
Everyone has had their eyeballs peeled to the head-to-head duels between Beauden Barrett and Richie Mo'unga, which have had a significant influence over match outcomes. These rivals are the heavy hitters in the meetings happening.
Statistics and Performance of the 2025 Team:
The Crusaders have not only scored more run (1048 to 982) over the last few games but they also have made more clean breaks (66 to 41) and played more tacklers and defenders they have beaten (215 to 162).
With Rob Penney and his coaching staff now firmly within the first full season of a four-year cycle, they are doing a great job of keeping their team effectively performing week-in, week-out.
To summarize:
1885 has had every extra hand whilst 1885's most very most recent meetings through to when 1885 will be followed for me very simply speaking by 1885 at 1885's/n/t/n/t/n/a/n/matchsome 2025 and found that they have nowhere left to go but forwards in 1885 versus 1885. Super Rugby Pacific is a pressure-cooker championship, and the games have been physically hard, strategically sophisticated and emotionally draining. Certainly the Crusaders have won a greater number of games, historically and more recently, but the Blues remain a stubborn foe capable of throwing a spanner in the works
